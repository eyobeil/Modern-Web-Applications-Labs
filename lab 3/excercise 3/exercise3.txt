Analysis of exercise3.js

1. when the synchronous readFileSync is used to read file, the memory allocated for node process 
will increase to the size of the file being read.
and as more requsets come, they will remain loading until prior requsets are done reading.
 this will consume disk spce in cpu too

 2. When the Async readFile is used the memory allocated for node process still increases but as more requsets come,
 they will start loading depending on the time of requests.

 3. When Streams is used to read a file as a small chunk, the change in memory allocation is insignificatly low. 
 and as more requests are sent, they will be served without increading disk space and memoy of cpu.
 its always better to use Streams to read and write data and use pipe to post on the response object.

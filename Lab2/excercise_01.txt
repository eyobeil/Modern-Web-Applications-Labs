1. Using setImmediate() instead of setTimeout(fn, timeout)

setImmediate will be executed immediately (after poll phase) while setTimeout will be executed after a minimum threshold has elapsed if both are invoked within an I/O cycle.

2. Difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()

process.nextTick interrupts the event loop and is executed immediately after the currently executed operation completes irregardless of the currently phase. setImmediate's callback has to wait for the event loop to enter the check phase to be executed.
